I'm currently working on my first massive project. This is a big undertaking and would not mind if other people chimed in to help. My project was inspired from braytech. I think the job they did on their website was amazing, so I've decided to create my own version with even more features and a new look. 

<h4 align="center">Current Plans</h4>
As of right now I've started working on the navigation/login bar, I have not put too much focus on responsiveness as of yet. I'm planning to build the base look of the website and then make it responsive once I have a good mock-up. Once the website is responsive I will move onto adding in behaviours, api's, etc...
